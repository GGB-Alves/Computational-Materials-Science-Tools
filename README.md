# Computational-Materials-Science-Tools
This is my collection of tool I've used or been using to ease my life as a
computational material science researcher.

I'm not an experienced programmer. I've just worked a bit with some simple
yet useful bash scripts and some Fortran programms, nothing too
fancy.Therefore, all codes will be likely very bad written, and badly
optimized, that's life.
